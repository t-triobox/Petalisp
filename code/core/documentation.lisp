A sequence with as many elements as the input rank of the transformation.

occur in the corresponding input position, or NIL, in which case any
integer may occur in the corresponding input position.

:OUTPUT-MASK

A sequence with as many elements as the output rank of the transformation.
Every element must either be an integer, in which case this integer denotes
the input entry that is to be scaled, shifted and sent to the current
position's output, or NIL, in which case only the corresponding offset
value is sent to the current output.  This way, the output mask can encode
both permutations of the input, as well as insertion and removal of axes.
If this keyword argument is not supplied, it defaults to a sequence with up
to input rank ascending integers, starting from zero, and followed by
entries of NIL in case the output rank is larger than the input rank.

:SCALINGS

A sequence with as many elements as the output rank of the transformation.
Each element must be a rational number.  Every transformation output is
scaled with its corresponding entry in this sequence.  If this keyword
argument is not supplied, it defaults to a sequence of ones.

:OFFSETS

A sequence with as many elements as the output rank of the transformation.
Each element must be a rational number that is added to the corresponding
output value after permutation and scaling has taken place. If this keyword
argument is not supplied, it defaults to a sequence of zeros."
