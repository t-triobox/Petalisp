;;; In this file, we partition each kernel into tasks.  We do this by first
;;; computing the optimal dimensions of a task, and then cut the domain
;;; into tasks that are at most as large as that.

(defgeneric optimal-task-dimensions (kernel processor backend))

;;; The default method for computing the optimal dimensions of a task is to
;;; chose a hypercube such that all loads and stores fit into that task's
;;; share of the caches.
;;;
;;; TODO: More sophisticated partitioning schemes are conceivable.  This is
;;; just a simple version to get things going.
