;;; The purpose of IR conversion is to turn a data flow graph, whose nodes
;;; are lazy arrays, into an analogous graph, whose nodes are buffers and
;;; kernels.  Kernels and buffers alternate, such that the inputs and
;;; outputs of a kernel are always buffers, and such that the inputs and
;;; outputs of a buffer are always kernels.
;;;
;;; The main data structure IR conversion algorithm are so called dendrites
;;; that grow from the lazy arrays that are the graph roots and along their
;;; inputs.  When a dendrite reaches an immediate, its growth stops.  While
;;; growing, dendrites create the instructions of a particular kernel,
;;; while keeping track of the current transformation and shape.  When a
;;; dendrite grows over a lazy array has more than one input, the dendrite
;;; branches out into multiple dendrites.  Each dendrite has a stem that
;;; tracks the kernel being generated.  All dendrites that are the result
;;; of branching out this way share the same stem.
;;;
;;; Whenever a dendrite reaches a lazy array with a refcount larger than
;;; one, or a lazy array that follows a broadcasting reshape operation, its
;;; growth is suspended and we record that this dendrite has reached that
;;; lazy array.  The data structure that tracks which dendrites have
;;; reached a particular lazy array is called a cluster.  Once the growth
;;; of all dendrites has been suspended or stopped, we pick the cluster
;;; whose lazy array has the highest depth from a priority queue.  This
;;; cluster is now turned into one or more buffers, and each buffer is the
;;; root of a stem with a single dendrite that is grown further.  Once
;;; there are no further clusters, the IR conversion is complete.
;;;
;;; A special case occurs when a dendrite reaches a fusion node with
;;; multiple inputs that intersect with the dendrite's shape.  In such a
;;; case, we want to replace the current kernel by multiple kernels, while
;;; choosing the iteration space of each kernel such that it reaches only a
;;; single input of the fusion node.  We achieve this by deleting both the
;;; stem's kernel, and all dendrites that originate from that stem.  Then
;;; we restart with one stem and kernel for each suitable subspace of the
;;; original stem.  In doing so, we eliminate fusion nodes altogether from
;;; the IR.
