;;; During IR conversion, we decide which lazy arrays can be integrated
;;; directly into one or more kernels, and which are actually turned into
;;; memory locations.  For the latter, we have to figure out in which way
;;; the data will be laid out in memory.  To do so, we create a hash table
;;; that assigns each of these lazy arrays a LAYOUT - an object that tracks
;;; all load and store instructions and decides on the size and number of
;;; temporary buffers.
;;;
;;; The general rule is that each kernel will have a single, homogeneous
;;; output buffer for each store instruction, and one homogeneous output
;;; buffer per load instructions.  Under certain circumstances, it is
;;; possible to merge several of these buffers to reduce the memory
;;; footprint.  For example, load instructions with similar transformations
;;; can use the same buffer, and store instructions can often use the same
;;; buffer as the largest target of future load instructions.
