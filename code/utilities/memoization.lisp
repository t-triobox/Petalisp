;;; Marco Heisig's Memoization Macros
;;;
;;; There are numerous libraries for memoization, but most of them succumb
;;; the temptation to provide a wrapper for DEFUN as primary API.  This
;;; fails to address several important use-cases
;;;
;;; - Memoization within CLOS, e.g. in :around methods
;;; - Explicit construction of the memoization key
;;; - Explicit specification of the memoization test
;;;
;;; To address these problems, this library uses lexical memoization, i.e.
;;; WITH-something macros that memoize the result of evaluating their body.
;;; Furthermore, there are different memoization macros for more or less
;;; fine-grained control over the memoization strategy.
;;;
;;; Thread safety is deliberately neglected.  Unconditional thread safety
;;; is relatively expensive (but please, run your own benchmarks) and other
;;; solutions are necessarily application specific.  One could even state
;;; that thread-safety is an ill-defined term, because in an application
;;; where only one thread calls a particular memoizing function, this
;;; library IS thread safe.

TEST) as some previously computed key, then BODY is not evaluated and the

be a valid hash table test designator.

If the optional form STORE-KEY is supplied, it is evaluated after any
evaluation of BODY and its value is used instead of KEY for storing the
results.  This way, KEY can be an object with dynamic extent (to avoid
consing) and STORE-KEY can create a copy with indefinite extent when
necessary."
